The markers displayed by the `osm-timeslider` visualization are extracted from the 10/2015 OpenStreetMap snapshot. The OpenStreetMap data is &copy; OpenStreetMap contributors, and available under the terms of the [ODbL](www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). More precisely, the data is from the snapshot from 5.10.2015 (29G, md5: `53510ecca3683c374230938f0a002fdf`).

The interactive map is drawn using the [Leaflet library](http://leafletjs.com/) (see below for its license) using the [Positron tiles](https://cartodb.com/basemaps). Tiles (c) CartoDB, CC BY 3.0.
